### classExample.cpp

Basic demonstration of Classes, the core component of the [Object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). A Rectangle is modeled: attributes and useful methods.

### STLSort.cpp

The good sort algorithm, of the powerful [Standard Template Library (STL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library), is explored. An array of defined Person data is sorted in terms of each person age (custom comparators) and the error caused by the default sort behavior is handled (operator overloading). Structs and Vectors along the journey.

### bitsAndChill.cpp

Especially good for competitive programmers, an example of how useful is to have an include-all library like bits/stdc++. Reinforcement on [how much a bad practice is to use this library](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-good-practice-to-use-include-bits-stdc%2B%2B-h-in-programming-contests-instead-of-listing-a-lot-of-includes/answer/Khan-Sadh-Mostafa?srid=uCns7) is taken in consideration.
